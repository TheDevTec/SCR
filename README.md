### This is an unstable version of SCR

# SCR

## What is SCR?
SCR is a fairly new project founded in 2018.
SCR was originally intended to serve as a non-full replacement for EssentialsX with better performance,
 but as the years went by this small project started to become bigger and bigger until it got to this form.
SCR project can now fully replace EssentialsX or CMI plugins. But as we know nothing is perfect, 
that's why we have been maintaining the project for over 4 years as open-source with discord support directly from us.

## What is SCR used for?
As mentioned above, it can do almost everything EssentialsX can do, but it also has a few features that only __paid__ CMI can have.
Such as custom Scoreboard, Tablist, Actionbar, Bossbar, Chatformat, Radius player chat, Multiworld, 
 fully editable translation file with JSON support (Hover text & Clicable messages) and much more.

## Are there any examples of what types of servers SCR can be used on?
We, as SCR developers, use it pretty much everywhere except in minigames. From the lobby server to Survival, Creative and RPG servers.
Since you can completely disable various functions in SCR, this makes SCR pretty much a lightweight plugin.

## What is our focus?
Above all, we focus on performance in all aspects. We also focus on multi-version support. (Plugin supports all versions from 1.7.10 onwards)
But we are also not afraid to add anything new that the discord community requests or votes for.
